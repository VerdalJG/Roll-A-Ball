Basic marble game in Unity 3D. The player can move using arrow keys to reach the goal zone of the levels. 

There are three levels and to unlock them, the player must reach a score threshold set for each level.

<h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>

- Arrow keys to move
- Speed pads that allow the player to go faster, but the player must be careful with accelerating too quickly
- Bumpers that knock the player away when crashing into them
- Collectibles that add to score (and some that subtract)
- Alternate paths
- Score bonus based on time left
